# Environments

This guide shows you how to create production, staging, and other environments.

## Overview

In order to serve your site on a specific domain, you need to configure an environment. Most sites have at least three environments: default, staging, and production. Free accounts are limited to a single environment (default). Paid accounts allow you to create as many environments as you need. Each environment consists of:

- **Domains** - one or more domains on which the site will be served. Domains cannot be set on the default environment. The domain name for the default environment is derived from your team and site's name.
- **Environment Variables** - secrets and other values that are specific to the environment and are not appropriate to check into source control. For example, API keys are commonly stored as environment variables
- **Split Testing** - Split traffic between multiple router destinations or other environments to conduct A/B testing or implement blue/green deployments.
- **Caching** - Each environment has a separate cache space that is automatically cleared each time you deploy. Use the _Caching_ tab to clear the cache by path or surrogate key.

## Creating an Environment

To create an environment, navigate to your site and select the _Environments_ tab, and click _New Environment_:

When creating an environment, you can choose whether or not to limit deployment capabilities to admins and deploy tokens, or to make it available to all members of the team:

![limit environment](/images/teams/environment-permissions.png?width=550)

## Deploying to an Environment

To deploy to an environment, you can `xdn deploy` with the `--environment` option:

```bash
xdn deploy <team name> --environment=<environment name>
```

You can also promote any existing deployment to an environment using the _Promote to Environment_ button at the top of the deployment view:

![promote](/images/environments/promote.png)

When configuring CI, we recommend:

- Automatically deploying to your staging environment when a PR is merged to the master branch of your repo.
- Manually promoting deployments to production using the Moovweb Console to prevent unwanted builds from being published by misconfigured CI workflows.

## Production Environment

To ensure that your production environment gets priority over all other environments during periods of high traffic, mark it as "production" by selecting this option during creation:

![promote](/images/environments/production.png)

Or from the environments list in the site view:

![promote](/images/environments/environments_table.png)

Failure to do so could cause your production environment to become slow if another environment experiences an unexpected surge in traffic, for example due to an attack or load test.

## Environment Versions

Since environments contain important settings that affect how your site functions, they are versioned. This makes it easy to roll back to a previous version of the environment if you make a change that breaks the site. To change your environment settings, create a new draft version by clicking the _Edit_ button:

![edit](/images/environments/edit.png)

As you make changes they are saved in the draft version. Once your ready to deploy your changes, click _Activate_.

![activate](/images/environments/activate.png)

Doing so will redeploy the environment's active deployment updated with the new environment configuration.

## Environment Variables

The variables you configure on an environment can be accessed in your code using `process.env`. A common use case is to configure
different backend host names in `xdn.config.js` based on the environment. Here is an example where the origin backend is determined
by a `HOST` environment variable.

```js
// xdn.config.js
const defaultHostname = 'origin.my-site.com'

module.exports = {
  backends: {
    origin: {
      domainOrIp: process.env.HOST || defaultHostname, // Falling back to defaultHostname is needed during the initial
      hostHeader: process.env.HOST || defaultHostname, // deployment of your site, when an environment is not yet configured.
    },
  },
}
```

Note that your `xdn.config.js` file is loaded during deployment to configure the edge for your environment. The first time you
deploy your site, there won't be any environment variables defined, so you need to include defaults in `xdn.config.js` as
shown in the example above.

### Built-in Environment Variables

XDN automatically injects the following environment variables:

- `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production` by default but you can override it through the console
- `XDN_ENVIRONMENT_NAME`: The name of the environment (e.g. `default`, `production` and so on). This cannot be overriden by you.

### Accessing Environment Variables at Build Time

As of XDN CLI version 2.19.0, when you deploy to an environment using a deploy token, for example by running `xdn deploy my-team --environment=production --token=(my token)` option, all environment variables are pulled down from the XDN Developer Console and applied to `process.env` so they can be accessed at build time. This allows you to store all of your build and runtime secrets in a single place, the XDN Developer Consoler, rather than storing some in your CI system's secret manager.

## dotenv

To configure secrets during local development, we recommend using [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).
If you would like to reference environment variables read from `.env` in `xdn.config.js`, add the following at the top
of `xdn.config.js`

```js
// xdn.config.js
require('dotenv').config()
```
