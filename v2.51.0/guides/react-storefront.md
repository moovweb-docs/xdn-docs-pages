# React Storefront

[React Storefront](https://docs.reactstorefront.io) helps developers build sub-second e-commerce progressive web apps in record time. This guide shows you how to deploy a React Storefront app on the XDN.

## Creating a React Storefront App

To create a new React Storefront app, run:

```bash
npm create react-storefront@^8.0.0 myapp
```

Select "Yes" when answering the following question:

```bash
? Will you be deploying your app on the Moovweb XDN? â€º no / yes
```

## Running Locally

To run your app locally:

```bash
npm start
```

## Deploying

Deploying requires an account on the Moovweb XDN. [Sign up here for free.](https://moovweb.app/signup) Once you have an account, you can deploy to the Moovweb XDN by running the following in the root folder of your project:

```bash
xdn deploy
```
